O parâmetro **style** se refere às propriedades de estilo do gráfico, em nosso caso, a cor das barras é definida como b (azul).

    "Também é possível plotar um DataFrame diretamente. Nesse caso, cada coluna é tratada como uma série separada. Por exemplo, em vez de imprimir o valor acumulado ao longo dos anos, podemos representar graficamente o valor de cada ano.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neste caso, usamos um gráfico de barras horizontal **(kind = 'barh')** empilhando todos os anos na mesma barra do país. Isso pode ser feito definindo o parâmetro **stacked** como True. O número de cores padrão em um gráfico é apenas 5, portanto, se você tiver mais de 5 séries para mostrar, será necessário especificar mais cores ou, caso contrário, o mesmo conjunto de cores será usado novamente. Podemos definir um novo conjunto de cores usando a palavra-chave **color** com uma lista de cores. As cores básicas têm um código de um único caractere atribuído a cada uma delas, por exemplo, 'b' para azul, 'r' para vermelho, 'g' para verde, 'y' para amarelo, 'm' para magenta e 'c' para ciano. Quando várias séries são mostradas em um gráfico, uma legenda é criada para identificar cada uma. O nome de cada série é o nome da coluna no DataFrame. Por padrão, a legenda fica dentro da área de plotagem. Se quisermos alterar, podemos usar a função de legenda do objeto de eixo (esse é o objeto retornado quando a função de gráfico é chamada). Usando a palavra-chave **loc**, podemos definir a posição relativa da legenda em relação ao gráfico. Pode ser uma combinação de direita ou esquerda e superior, inferior ou central. Com bbox_to_anchor podemos definir uma posição absoluta em relação ao gráfico, o que nos permite colocar a legenda fora do gráfico."
